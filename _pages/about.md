I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of Physics](https://spe.sysu.edu.cn/), [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/). My research interest includes AdS/CFT correspondence, 2D CFT and related topics.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ren Jie](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1029004) in my research on the AdS/CFT correspondence, QNMs of black holes, and Virasoro conformal blocks.

You can find my CV here:
